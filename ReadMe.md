Proposal:

do analytics on major Magic: the Gathering tournaments

How:
via a reusable tool that can:
1. take in jsons of decks in a metagame, or a specific tournament via webscraping
2. assign an embedding to the cards and decks and archetypes in a given batch
3. using the RAG assignment as a model, give ai analytics on what decks are the best to use in a subset, other cool data like what are the more unique decks that placed high, what was the cheapest deck that did well, etc
4. show all this data that I have scrounged on a vercel app, where I can keep tabs on different analytics I have done to reference from in the future
5. have a (probably) redis database storing things for the project
